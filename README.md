## How to use
To use the bot you can invite the UntitledDiscordBot using this 
[link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=697420452712284202&scope=bot&permissions=2134207679), 
or you can build it yourself. You can find all available commands by typing `/`
### Verification
To use the verification feature, create a base role called `Member`. Next create a channel called `verify` for anyone 
except people with roles. Make them type `/verify` to enter the server

You can also use the following set command to make a member role
```
/generate member-role
```
### Welcome/Goodbye messages
To use the welcome and goodbye messages add `ubot-welcome` to the channel's topic

You can also use the following set function
```
/set welcome <ping to channel>
```
### Event tracking
To track events make a channel that is available to the bot and add to the topic the following word `ubot-event-log`. 
Now every time something happens in the server it will be logged!

You can also use the following set command to make this channel
```
/set event-tracking <ping to channel>
```
### Restricted/Topic locked channels
Some channels can be restricted by adding one of the following keywords in the topic of a channel
1. `ubot-restrict-text-only` text messages only
2. `ubot-restrict-attachments-only` attachments and links only
3. `ubot-restrict-links-only` links only

Instead of doing this manually you can also use the set commands
1. `/set text-only <ping to channnel>`
2. `/set attachments-only <ping to channnel>`
3. `/set links-only <ping to channnel>`
